                    <p>Deciding in which neighbourhood we would like to stay in is an important aspect of our trip to
                        London.</br>
                        Nevertheless, we might also be interested in picking an accommodation that is suitable to our
                        needs.</br>

                        <h5 class="card-title">Entire home/apartment</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Entire home/apartments are definitely the most popular in neighbourhoods
                            like Westminster, Camden and Kensington & Chelsea.</br>
                            However, as we have discovered in the previous bubble charts, they tend to be quite
                            expensive compared to other neighbourhoods.</br>
                            If we are on a budget but we also value privacy,
                            we might want to opt for Islington, Tower Hamlets or Hackney.

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h5 class="card-title">Private room</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Private rooms are also quite popular among hosts on AirBnB.</br>
                            Especially in neighbourhood that tend to be slightly cheaper like Tower Hamlets, Hackney but
                            also Southwark.</br>
                            We also have to consider there will be a substantial difference in price between
                            booking an entire home/apt or getting a private room. </p>

                        <h5 class="card-title">Shared room</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Shared rooms are more difficult to find in London. Nevertheless, it seems
                            Westminster, Camden and Kensington & Chelsea dominate even in these types of offerings.

                        <p class="card-text">Similar to shared rooms, hotel rooms are also more difficult to find in
                            London.</br>
                            Nevertheless, it seems Westminster, Camden and Kensington & Chelsea dominate even in these
                            types of offerings.</br>
                            If we decide to book a hotel room via AirBnB, we might want to review our choice of selected
                            neighbourhoods, as only a few central areas seem to have listings.
