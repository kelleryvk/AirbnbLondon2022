                    <p>Outliers in price account for 7.12% of records. </br>
                        This is due to a few listings posted in popular
                        areas with above-market prices. Given they can skew the boxplot visualization, we removed them
                        from the dataset. </br>
                        We can normalize (cap out) the outliers by using the interquartile range and then re-run the
                        boxplot via seaborn library. </br>
                        
                        Overall, it seems above £100 budget the majority of visitors tend to use an Entire home but
                        below they tend to use Private rooms. In addition, the boxplot helps us identify minimum, median
                        and maximum prices per each room type. Hotel rooms remain the most expensive, whilst shared
                        rooms the cheapest. Moreover, it gives us a few useful information regarding both private rooms
                        and shared rooms. Both present points outside the whiskers that might not be considered to be
                        “outliers”. These more likely tell us data are positively skewed with median closer to the
                        bottom quartile (mean > median) therefore prices constitute higher frequency of high recorded
                        prices.

                    <p>Surprisingly, the average number of reviews seems to be higher for the category Hotel room
                        listings
                        whilst lowest for the most popular type of accommodations (Entire home/apt).</br>
                        The lower values for Entire home/apt and Private room are explained by the fact that, in these
                        categories, there are much more listings with no reviews.</br>
                        Nevertheless, when looking at the total number of reviews, we can argue there can be cases in
                        which
                        Entire home/apt and Private room have been reviewed and therefore, we may be able to get a fair
                        picture of the accommodation we are about to book.
